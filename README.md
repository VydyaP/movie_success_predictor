# movie_success_predictor

This project aims to predict the commercial success of movies using supervised machine learning. Based on the IMDb Top 1000 Movies dataset, features like Gross, IMDB Rating, Meta Score, Votes, and Runtime were used to train a Random Forest Classifier. The model classifies movies as either "Success" or "Flop" with over 98% accuracy, demonstrating the potential of data-driven insights in the film industry
